Variables:

Variables are used to store data by giving a name to it. variables are declared with keyword var. 
Ex:1 var firstName = 'viswa';
    console.log(firstName);
output: viswa
In above example the 'firstName' comes after var is used as a name/container to refer to the data ('viswa' is the data in this example.).
Here console.log is used to display the data ('viswa' here) using command prompt.
Ex:2 var age ='25';
     console.log(age);
output: 25

Strings:

A group of characters are strings.In Javascript 'strings' are primitive values, which means can reference a object. 

In javascript Strings have a property --length

Ex: var firstName = 'viswa';
    var firstNameLength = firstName.length;
    console.log(firstNameLength);
output: 5
Here '5' is the length of the string 'viswa'

Functions:

function are declared using keyword 'function'. function is used to reference a block of code or you can say 
function is used to reference  a list of instructions. function are given a 'name' or some times there are anonymous
function as well. 'name' of a function is used to invoke a function.

Ex:
function hello(){}

above defined a function named as hello and in between curly braces code is written. 

function hello(){
 console.log('hello!');
}

hello();

output: hello!

Here in above code hello(); is used to invoke a function.

function hello(firstName){
     var meassage = 'Hi' + firstName;
 console.log(message);
}


hello('viswa');
hello('mani');

output:  Hi Viswa
         Hi mani

In above code passing a parameter inside paranthesis (hello(parameter) ) and the arguments passed inside paranthesisinto hello('arguments') are displayed 
in the command prompt using console.log(message);

if statements:

if statements are conditional like excecution of a block of code is done if condition satisfied or we can say if condition is true.
else statement is executed if the condition is false.
else if is like similar to if , but execution is done if above statement fails and its block of code is executed if condition is satisfed or condition is true.

Ex:
function isPrime(num) {
if (num>1){
    for( var i =2; i<num; i++){
        if(num%i === 0){
            return false;
            }
        }
            return true;
           
        }else{
            return false;
  }
} 

Boolean Values:

Boolean has two values True or false, we use boolean to know whether expression/ variable is true or false. we can implement boolean values on logical operators(||, &&),
conditional statements. we have a handy boolean function in javascript.
Ex: Boolean(1) 
which is invoked as a function.
